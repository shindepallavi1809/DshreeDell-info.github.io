    <h1>Introduction Of Dell Company</h1>

    <p>Dell is an American multinational computer technology company that develops, sells, repairs, and supports
      computers and related products and services.
      Named after its founder, Michael Dell, the company is one of the largest technology corporations in the world,
      employing more than 165,000 people in the U.S.
      and around the world. It is one of the biggest PC product companies in the world.<br>
      <br>

      Dell sells personal computers (PCs), servers, data storage devices, network switches, software, computer
      peripherals, HDTVs, cameras, printers and electronics
      built by other manufacturers. The company is well known for its innovations in supply chain management and
      electronic commerce, particularly its direct-sales
      model and its "build-to-order" or "configure to order" approach to manufacturing—delivering individual PCs
      configured to customer specifications. Dell was
      a pure hardware vendor for much of its existence, but with the acquisition in 2009 of Perot Systems, Dell entered
      the market for IT services. The company has since
      made additional acquisitions in storage and networking systems, with the aim of expanding their portfolio from
      offering computers only to delivering complete solutions
      for enterprise customers.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h2>Growth in the 1990s and early 2000s</h2>
    <p>
      Originally, Dell did not emphasize the consumer market, due to the higher costs and unacceptably-low profit
      margins
      selling to individuals and households; this changed when the company's Internet site took off in 1996 and 1997.
      While the
      industry's average selling price to individuals was going down, Dell's was going up, as second- and third-time
      computer
      buyers who wanted powerful computers with multiple features and did not need much technical support were choosing
      Dell.
      Dell found an opportunity among PC-savvy individuals who liked the convenience of buying direct, customizing their
      PC to
      their means, and having it delivered in days. In early 1997, Dell created an internal sales and marketing group
      dedicated
      to serving the home market and introduced a product line designed especially for individual users</p>

    <p>From 1997 to 2004, Dell enjoyed steady growth and it gained market share from competitors even during industry
      slumps.
      During the same period, rival PC vendors such as Compaq, Gateway, IBM, Packard Bell, and AST Research struggled
      and eventually
      left the market or were bought out. Dell surpassed Compaq to become the largest PC manufacturer in 1999. Operating
      costs
      made up only 10 percent of Dell's $35 billion in revenue in 2002, compared with 21 percent of revenue at
      Hewlett-Packard,

      25 percent at Gateway, and 46 percent at Cisco. In 2002, when Compaq merged with Hewlett-Packard (the fourth-place
      PC maker)
      , the newly combined Hewlett-Packard took the top spot but struggled and Dell soon regained its lead. Dell grew
      the
      fastest in the early 2000s.
      <br>
      <br>
      Dell attained and maintained the top rating in PC reliability and customer service/technical support, according to
      Consumer Reports, year after year, during the mid-to-late 1990s through 2001 right before Windows XP was released.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1996, Dell began selling computers through its website.

      In the mid-1990s, Dell expanded beyond desktop computers and laptops by selling servers, starting with low-end
      servers.
      e major three providers of servers at the time were IBM, Hewlett-Packard, and Compaq, many of which were based on
      proprietary technology, such as IBM's Power4 microprocessors or various proprietary versions of the Unix operating
      system.
      ll's new PowerEdge servers did not require a major investment in proprietary technologies, as they ran Microsoft
      Windows NT
      on Intel chips, and could be built cheaper than its competitors. Consequently, Dell's enterprise revenues, almost
      nonexistent in 1994, accounted for 13 percent of the company's total intake by 1998. Three years later, Dell
      passed Compaq
      as the top provider of Intel-based servers, with 31 percent of the market. Dell's first acquisition occurred in
      1999 with
      the purchase of ConvergeNet Technologies for $332 million, after Dell had failed to develop an enterprise storage
      system in-
      house; ConvergeNet's elegant but complex technology did not fit in with Dell's commodity-producer business model,
      forcing
      Dell to write down the entire value of the acquisition.<br>
      <br>

      In 2002, Dell expanded its product line to include televisions, handhelds, digital audio players, and printers.
      Chairman and CEO Michael Dell had repeatedly blocked President and COO Kevin Rollins's attempt to lessen the
      company's
      heavy dependency on PCs, which Rollins wanted to fix by acquiring EMC Corporation.<br>
      <br>

      In 2003, the company was rebranded as simply "Dell Inc.", to recognize the company's expansion beyond
      computers.<br>

      In 2004, Michael Dell resigned as CEO while retaining the position of Chairman,handing the CEO title to Kevin
      Rollins,
      who had been President and COO since 2001. Despite no longer holding the CEO title, Dell essentially acted as a de
      facto co-CEO with Rollins.
      <br>
      Under Rollins, Dell acquired Alienware, a manufacturer of high-end PCs, targeted mainly towards the gaming market.

    <h2>DELL LOGO</h2>
    <p>The original Dell logo created in 1984 featured the company name in a simple serif font.
      Five years later, the iconic “slanted E” emblem appeared. According to the company, it was a visual
      representation of Michael Dell’s wish to “turn the world on its ear”. The emblem featured solid letters in dark
      blue color.<br><br>

      The next logo update took place in 2010, when a circular outline appeared around the wordmark. In 2016,
      following the merger with EMC Corporation, Dell modified its logotype once again. The typeface acquired a thinner
      look.
      However, the very shape of the letters, including the slanted “E” stayed unchanged.

    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="center">
    <img src="logoimages.png">
  </div>
  <p>The visual identity history of Del has been pretty constant from the end of the 1980s, but before the company used
    two different versions of the logo, and the very first was designed for PC’s Limited, the original name of Dell,
    established in 1984.</p>
  <div>
    <h3>1984 — 1987
    </h3>
    <div class="center"><img src="Dell-Logo-1984.jpg" width="280" height="200"></div>

    <p>The initial logo, created for PC’s Limited, featured a bold black logotype in all capitals, executed in a
      narrowed
      sans-serif typeface with very thick lines of the letters. The wordmark was placed on the right from an abstract
      geometric
      emblem, consisting of a square figure formed by numerous black lines. The monochrome color palette of the
      company’s visual
      identity made it look strong and professional, reflecting the purpose and essence of the brand.</p><br>
    <br>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h3>1987 — 1991</h3>
    <div class="center"> <img src="Dell-Logo-1987.jpg" width="280" height="200">
    </div><br>
    <p>The company was renamed Dell three years after its establishment and this is when the new logo was adopted.
      The elegant capitalized logotype in black was executed in a fancy serif typeface and placed between two blue
      horizontal lines. It was simple yet sophisticated and professional and looked bright and cool due to its new
      color palette.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h3>1989 — 2010</h3>
    <div class="center"><img src="Dell-Logo-1989.jpg" width="280" height="200"></div>
    <p>The intense blue color became the main one in the Dell color palette with the redesign of 1989.
      The new emblem, designed by Siegel+Gale design bureau, featured a bold sans-serif logotype with the
      letter “E” placed diagonally, inclined to the left. This badge became iconic and was in use by the company
      until 2018, though even today the brand has its modified version as the primary one.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h3>2010 — 2016</h3>
    <div class="center"><img src="Dell-Logo-2010.jpg" width="280" height="200"></div>
    <p>The iconic blue logotype executed in Futura Extra Bold font was enclosed in a circular frame, drawn in the same
      shade of blue. The new figure balanced the sharp and strict look of the letter-lines and made the image more
      stylish and smooth. There were some minor changes done to the inscription itself: more space was added between
      two “L”s and the lines of the wordmark became a bit thinner.

    </p>

  </div>
  <div>
    <h3>2016 — Today </h3>
    <div class="center"><img src="Dell-logo.jpg" width="280" height="200"></div>
    <p>The De logo was redesigned again in 2016 to celebrate the company’s merger with EMC. The color palette and
      style of the iconic logo remained untouched, though the typeface was changed to a more lightweight one, with
      thin straight lines, and it made the brand’s logo fresher and crispier, with more white color in it, the badge
      started evoking a sense of reliability and loyalty.

    </p>
